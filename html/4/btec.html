<h1>about </h1>
<p>The Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering & Technology was founded in Kalady with the intention of offering value-added technical education that inculcates in the student professional excellence and ethical values. The institution is managed by the Adi Sankara Trust, a registered organisation which has made a name for itself in the field of education. For more than 50 years, the trust has successfully run different types of educational institutions.

The college, which was founded in 2001 and skilfully maintained by the Sringeri Mutt with the benign blessings of His Holiness Sri Sri Bharathi Tirtha Mahaswamiji, is committed to maintaining a proactive approach to ensure the students' holistic development.
