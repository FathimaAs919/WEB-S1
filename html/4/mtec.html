<h1>about </h1>
<p>The department has evolved a comprehensive student-centric learning approach, designed to add significant value to the learner's understanding in an integrated manner through workshops, lab sessions, assignments, training, seminars, projects and independent study.The hands-on training offered by our CAD/CAM laboratory in the latest design and analysis software brings in a formal method of familiarizing with the industrial practices. This helps the students to apply their classroom knowledge to live industrial problems. The department is equipped with ten laboratories, and nine workshops. The laboratories and computing facilities are made available to the students and staff until late at night and on all working days.
